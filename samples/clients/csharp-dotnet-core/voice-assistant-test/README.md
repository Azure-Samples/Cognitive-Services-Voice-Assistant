# Voice Assistant Test Tool

## Overview

The Voice Assistant Test (VST) tool is a configurable .NET core C# console application for end-to-end functional regression tests for your Microsoft [Voice Assistant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/voice-assistants). It uses the [Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.Dialog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog?view=azure-dotnet) APIs in the [Speech SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk) to execute a set of single or multi-turn dialogs against your bot or Custom Commands web application. JSON files are authored to specify what the client sends to the bot and the expected bot response, for every turn in the dialog. The tool can run manually as a console command or automated as part of Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to prevent regressions in your bot.

Voice Assistant Test supports the following:

- Any Bot-Framework bot or Custom Commands web application
- Sending a text message, full [Bot-Framework Activity](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/master/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md) or audio from a WAV file up to the bot
- Specifying the expected bot reply Activities
- Ability to filter out (ignore) bot reply Activities as needed
- Verifying the duration of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) audio response from the bot
- Verifying a bot greeting (automatic Activities sent from the bot after initial connection)
- Measuring the duration it took for the bot to reply
- Keyword activation on the input audio

## Prerequisites

- A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
- A bot built using [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://blog.botframework.com/2018/05/07/build-a-microsoft-bot-framework-bot-with-the-bot-builder-sdk-v4/) and hosted on Azure or other cloud service. The bot needs to be voice-enabled and registered with [Direct Line Speech](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) channel to send and receive audio. [See this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) to get your started. Use your own deployed bot to try out this tool, or one of the many [Bot-Framework samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples). 
- Alternatively, a [Custom Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/custom-commands) web application hosted on Azure on your behalf, instead of a Bot-Framework bot.
- A Windows PC with Windows 10 or later and [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Note: The source code should compile and run on any of the [supported .NET Core platforms](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md) but the only platform verified so far is Windows.

## Getting started guide

First time users, please follow the [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING-STARTED-GUIDE.md) for a step by step introduction on how to write configuration files and run tests.

## Reference guide

### Definitions

- The application executes a single or multiple **Tests** when it runs.
- Each test contains a single or multiple **Dialogs**.
- A dialog contains a single or multiple **Turns**.

The tests are set up by authoring two types of [JSON files](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159):

- [**Application Configuration**](#application-configuration-file) JSON file - Configuration settings that apply globally to all dialogs in all tests. This JSON file is the only input argument to the application.
- [**Test Configuration**](#test-configuration-file) JSON file - Settings that are unique to this test, including specifications of all the dialogs and their turns for this test.

The Application Configuration JSON file will list one or more Test Configuration JSON files.

### JSON templates

When creating new tests, you may find it useful to start from these templates and modify them, as they contain all the supported JSON fields. Fields that are optional are present and set to their default value.

- [Example of an Application Configuration file](docs\json-templates\app-config-template.json)
- [Example of a Test Configuration file](docs\json-templates\test-config-template.json)

## Topics

#### Writing tests with keyword spotting

To test a Bot with an audio input with a keyword, populate "KeywordRecognitionModel" in Application Configuration file with the full path of the table file and set the boolean "Keyword" in the test configuration file to "true" if the WAV file used for testing has a keyword.

The keyword that has been recognized will be populated in the output file.

A dialog can only have a Keyword in Turn 0.

#### Ignoring certain bot-reply activities

Tool waits for certain amount of time or until it hits timeout and captures all the Bot-reply activities received for each turn. This time is equal to the length of the ExpectedResponses array that is set in the test configuration file. Tool perfoms validations on these captured Bot-reply activities to check if the turn is passed or failed.

In order to ignore any one of the Bot-reply activities received for each turn by the tool, "IgnoreActivities" field is to be set in the Application Configuration file.
"IgnoreActivities" is an Array that holds the list of activities that are ignored by the tool. The amount of time for which tool waits to capture the Bot-reply activities does not include the Bot-reply activities that were marked ignore.

Example : [{"type": "typing","name": "trace"}, {"name": "QnAMaker"}]

In the above example tool ignores all activities which are of type : "typing"and name : "trace" and all activities which have "name" : "QnAMaker".

#### Testing bot response TTS Audio duration

A Bot-reply activity with speak field populated, will have a TTS audio.
Tool stores this TTS audio in a WAV file. The duration of TTS audio is calculated and is verified if it falls within the range of ExpectedTTSAudioResponseDuration +/- AudioDurationMargin.
if the test is passed TTSAudioResponseDurationMatch is set to true otherwise false.

#### Testing bot-greetings

Bot-Greeting - It is an automatic Bot response that happens when client connect to the Bot with no input from the client.
Application Configuration file holds a field called "Bot Greeting" that should be set to true when a Bot has a greeting.

For testing the Bot Greeting when,
-SingleConnection = "true", test configuration file should include a Dialog 0, Turn 0 entry with no input fields(Utterance, Activity and WavFile) speciied
-SingleConnection = "false",test configuration file should include a Turn 0 entry on every Dialog with no input fields(Utterance, Activity and WavFile) specified

#### Single connection and Multiple connection tests

Single Connection tests:
When the "SingleConnection" in the Application Configuration file is set to true, a new connection is established with Bot for each Test Configuration file.
Multiple Connection tests:
When "SingleConnection" in the Application Configuration file is set to false,a new connection is established with Bot for each Dialog in a Test Configuration file.

#### Skipping tests

Tests can be skipped either at the Test Configuration file level or at the Dialog level.

In order to skip a file from the test suite, set the skip field for that file to true in the Application Configuration file.

Example:

```

"InputFiles":[
  {
    "FileName": "test-config-template1.json",
    "SingleConnection": true,
    "Skip": true
    "IgnoreActivities": []
  },
  {
    "FileName": "test-config-template2.json",
    "SingleConnection": true,
    "Skip": true
    "IgnoreActivities": []
  }
]

```

In the above example test configuration file "test-config-template1.json" will be skipped from testing.

In order to skip a Dialog from testing, set the skip field to true for that Dialog in the test configuration file

Example:

```

[
  {
    "DialogID": 0,
    "Description": "Dialog - 0",
    "Skip": true,
    "Turns": [
      {
        "TurnID": 0,
        "Sleep": 10,
        "Utterance": "Testing Dialog 0",
        "Activity": "",
        "WavFile": "",
        "ExpectedResponses": [
          {
            "text": "Testing turn 0."
          }
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
  {
    "DialogID": 1,
    "Description": "Dialog - 1",
    "Skip": false,
    "Turns": [
      {
        "TurnID": 0,
        "Sleep": 0,
        "Utterance": "Testing Dialog 1",
        "Activity": "",
        "WavFile": "",
        "ExpectedResponses": [
          {
            "text": "testing turn 1"
          }
        ],
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

In the above example Dialog 0 will be skipped from testing.

#### Pausing between dailogs or turns

#### Creating new tests ("bootstrapping")

While creating your own Test configuration file,bootstrapping mode is useful in order to capture all the bot responses

In order to set a turn to bootstrapping mode,in Test Configuration file set the ExpectedResponses field to either null or empty or dont specify it in the

In this mode,tool captures all the bot responses ,doesnt perform any validations and sets the test to pass.
