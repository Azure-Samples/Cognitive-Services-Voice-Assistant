# Getting Started Guide

## Samples List

Get started implementing your own Application using Azure Cognitive Services. To use the samples provided, clone this GitHub repository using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant.git
cd Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/
```

## Getting Started with Sample

1. > Follow the [Voice-enable your bot using the Speed SDK Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) to enable the your bot to use the Direct Line Speech Channel.
2. > Copy the Cognitive Services Speech API Key by clicking on the Azure Speech resource created in the above listed tutorial
3. > [Set up the Configuration file and Input files](###Sample-Configurations-and-Tests)

### Sample Configurations and Tests

Navigate to [docs/examples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/tree/master/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/docs/examples) to find Core Bot and Echo Bot folder with sample configurations and tests. Paste the appropriate Bot Speech Key and Region in the Config.json files in each example folder.

Please see [Configuration File Structure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/blob/sajjadp/VAReadmeUpdateFeb42020/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/README.md#Application-Configuration-file) for reference and modify the sample configurations appropriately

For examples of configuration and test files, please see the templates in [docs/json-templates/](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/tree/master/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/docs/json-templates)

| Example 3 | Multiple tests containing multi-turn dialogs with text and wav files as input |                                                                                                     |

### Modifying Core Bot Configuration File

1. > cd to docs/examples/corebot/example1
2. > Open CoreBotConfig.json
3. > Populate the InputFolder, and OuputFolder fields with the full path to this folder
4. > Enter the Speech Key and Region associated with your Voice Enabled Core Bot in the SubscriptionKey and Region fields respectively.
5. > [Run Voice Assistant Test](###Run-Voice-Assistant-Test)
6. > Open the folder specified in the OutputFolder to find the OutputFiles generated for the Test.
7. > cd to docs/examples/corebot/example2 and repeat steps 2 - 6

### Modifying Core Bot Test File

After running corebot/example2, take a look at VoiceAssistantTest.log. You will notice that Dialog 0 for SingleDialogTest1.json failed. Now take a look at SingleDialogTest1Ouput/SingleDialogTest1Output.txt, you will see that the text and speak fields in ExpectedResponses for Dialog 0 Turn 2 do not match the text and speak fields in ActualResponses.
To Fix this,
Paste the following for Dialog 0 Turn 2 in SingleDialogTest1.json

```
      {
        "TurnID": 2,
        "Utterance": "Yes",
        "Activity": "",
        "WavFile": "",
        "ExpectedResponses": [
          {
            "type": "message",
            "text": "I have you booked to New York from Seattle on 10th February 2025",
            "speak": "I have you booked to New York from Seattle on 10th February 2025",
            "inputHint": "ignoringInput"
          },
          {
            "type": "message",
            "text": "What else can I do for you?",
            "speak": "What else can I do for you?",
            "inputHint": "expectingInput"
          }
        ]
      }
```

Looking at the VoiceAssistantTest.log, you will see that Dialog 0 has now passed. The tool checks Expected with Actual to determine if a dialog and turn passes or fails.

### Run Voice Assistant Test

1. ```
   Open Command prompt

   cd to Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/tool/
   dotnet build -c Release
   cd to bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/
   dotnet.exe VoiceAssistantTest.dll {Full path of configuration file to run}
   ```

2. In the path specified in the OutputFolder of the configuration file, you will find the VoiceAssistantTest logs, report, and test output for each Test File.

```
Note : If you want to run the application through a Visual Studio debugger add the configuration file path to application arguments.
Click on Solution > Properties > Debug > Enter the configuration file path to application arguments
```
