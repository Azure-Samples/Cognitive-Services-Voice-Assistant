# Getting Started Guide

## Overview
This is a step-by-step guide for first time users of the tool, showing how to write configuration files for the most common end-to-end tests, and how to run the tool. The guide uses Bot-Framework's "Echo Bot" and "Core Bot" as the example bot to be tested.

## Step 1: Clone the repo and build the tool

Per the prerequisite, make sure you have the following installed on your Windows 10 PC:
- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Clone the repo to some folder on your PC (e.g. "c:\repo" in this example) and build the tool from the command line:

```cmd
cd /d c:\repo
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant.git
cd Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant\samples\clients\csharp-dotnet-core\voice-assistant-test\tool
dotnet build
```

The build will create a self-contained .NET core executable VoiceAssistantTest.exe in a "publish" folder that you can copy to your working folder, where you will run your tests. It's best not to run the test under your repo folder. Create a test folder (e.g. "c:\test" in this example), copy the executable to this folder and run it without arguments:

```cmd
cd /d c:\test
copy c:\repo\Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant\samples\clients\csharp-dotnet-core\voice-assistant-test\tool\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\win-x64\publish\VoiceAssistnatText.exe
VoiceAssistantText.exe
```
You will get the following error:
```
VoiceAssistantTest Error: 0 : System.ArgumentException: Configuration file is not specified. Please pass a valid configuration file as an argument.
```
This is good. The tool works. You are now ready to author your first application and test configuration files. The application configuration file is needed as the single run-time argument when running the tool. But before we write the test, we need to make sure we have a bot web service hosted to test against.

## Step 2: Deploy the Echo Bot

In order to write and execute your first test, you will need to deploy Bot Framework's "echo bot" into your own Azure subscription. The echo bot has to then be voiced enabled and registered with Direct Line Speech channel. This is all covered in details in the ["Voice-enable your bot using the Speech SDK"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) tutorial. Go ahead to spend some time doing the tutorial. At the end, and before proceeding with this guide, you should have:
* A Cognitive Services speech key. 
* An Azure region associated with the speech key.
* An Echo Bot hosted in your Azure subscription, registered with Direct Line Speech channel, and verified to be working end-to-end using the [Windows Voice Assistant Client](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/tree/master/samples/clients/csharp-wpf) application.

## Step 3: Write your first test!

As you have noticed when you tested the echo bot, it supports a "greeting". This is when the bot automatically sends a message (or messages) to the client application as soon as a connection is made with the bot. Let's write a simple test to verify that the bot sends the correct greeting message.

First, we will write the Application configuration. Copy and paste the following to your text editor: 
```json
{
  "Tests": [
    {
      "FileName": "GreetingTest.json",
    }
  ],
  "SubscriptionKey": "89t7s45tyu2i7y9j908w345u57962eb2",
  "Region": "westus2",
  "BotGreeting": true,
  "InputFolder": "c:\\test\\",
  "OutputFolder": "c:\\test\\"
}
```
Replace "SubscriptionKey" and "Region" fields with your own speech key and region, and save it as file "AppConfig.json" in your test folder (e.g. c:\test).

The application configuration file instructs the tool to execute the dialogs listed in a single test file "GreetingTest.json". We will create that file shortly. 

All needed input files (just "GreetingTest.json" in this case) and output files will be written to the current folder since the "InputFolder" and "OutputFolder" are blank. 

"BotGreeting" field needs to be specified and set to true for echo bot tests, since by default it is false. A "true" value instructs the tool to verify that the test configuration is written correctly and the test is executed expecting a bot greeting after connection is established with the bot.

Now, write the test configuration. Copy and paste the following to your text editor and save the file as "AppConfig.json" in your test folder (e.g. c:\test):

```json
[
  {
    "DialogID": 0,
    "Description": "test echo bot greeting",
    "Turns": [
      {
        "TurnID": 0,
        "ExpectedResponses": [
          {
            "type": "message",
            "text": "Hello and welcome!",
            "speak": "Hello and welcome!",
            "inputHint": "acceptingInput",
          }
        ],
        "ExpectedTTSAudioResponseDuration": 1800,
        "ExpectedResponseLatency": "2000"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```


!! *TODO: Make these work:*
* *"VoiceAssistantTest.exe AppSetting.json" (no need to specify full path to app settings file)*
* *app settings files should have a working default where "InputFolder" and "OutputFolder" are not specified.*



## Getting Started with Sample

1. > Follow the [Voice-enable your bot using the Speed SDK Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/tutorial-voice-enable-your-bot-speech-sdk) to enable the your bot to use the Direct Line Speech Channel.
2. > Copy the Cognitive Services Speech API Key by clicking on the Azure Speech resource created in the above listed tutorial
3. > [Set up the Configuration file and Input files](###Sample-Configurations-and-Tests)

### Sample Configurations and Tests

Navigate to [docs/examples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/tree/master/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/docs/examples) to find Core Bot and Echo Bot folder with sample configurations and tests. Paste the appropriate Bot Speech Key and Region in the Config.json files in each example folder.

Please see [Configuration File Structure](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/blob/sajjadp/VAReadmeUpdateFeb42020/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/README.md#Application-Configuration-file) for reference and modify the sample configurations appropriately

For examples of configuration and test files, please see the templates in [docs/json-templates/](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/tree/master/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/docs/json-templates)

### Modifying Core Bot Configuration File

1. > cd to docs/examples/corebot/example1
2. > Open CoreBotConfig.json
3. > Populate the InputFolder, and OuputFolder fields with the full path to this folder
4. > Enter the Speech Key and Region associated with your Voice Enabled Core Bot in the SubscriptionKey and Region fields respectively.
5. > [Run Voice Assistant Test](###Run-Voice-Assistant-Test)
6. > Open the folder specified in the OutputFolder to find the OutputFiles generated for the Test.
7. > cd to docs/examples/corebot/example2 and repeat steps 2 - 6

### Modifying Core Bot Test File

After running corebot/example2, take a look at VoiceAssistantTest.log. You will notice that Dialog 0 for SingleDialogTest1.json failed. Now take a look at SingleDialogTest1Ouput/SingleDialogTest1Output.txt, you will see that the text and speak fields in ExpectedResponses for Dialog 0 Turn 2 do not match the text and speak fields in ActualResponses.
To Fix this,
Paste the following for Dialog 0 Turn 2 in SingleDialogTest1.json

```
      {
        "TurnID": 2,
        "Utterance": "Yes",
        "Activity": "",
        "WavFile": "",
        "ExpectedResponses": [
          {
            "type": "message",
            "text": "I have you booked to New York from Seattle on 10th February 2025",
            "speak": "I have you booked to New York from Seattle on 10th February 2025",
            "inputHint": "ignoringInput"
          },
          {
            "type": "message",
            "text": "What else can I do for you?",
            "speak": "What else can I do for you?",
            "inputHint": "expectingInput"
          }
        ]
      }
```

Looking at the VoiceAssistantTest.log, you will see that Dialog 0 has now passed. The tool checks Expected with Actual to determine if a dialog and turn passes or fails.

### Run Voice Assistant Test

1. ```
   Open Command prompt

   cd to Cognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant/samples/clients/csharp-dotnet-core/voice-assistant-test/tool/
   dotnet build -c Release
   cd to bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/
   dotnet.exe VoiceAssistantTest.dll {Full path of configuration file to run}
   ```

2. In the path specified in the OutputFolder of the configuration file, you will find the VoiceAssistantTest logs, report, and test output for each Test File.

```
Note : If you want to run the application through a Visual Studio debugger add the configuration file path to application arguments.
Click on Solution > Properties > Debug > Enter the configuration file path to application arguments
```
