## Things you will need
* An Azure subscription. [Azure](https://portal.azure.com)
* Powershell 6.0 or greater [Download Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)

## Deploying Azure Resources
1. Click the button below:<br/>
<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2FCognitive-Services-Voice-Assistant%2Fchschrae%2FazureDeployScripts%2Fcustom%2520commands%2Fhospitality%2Fdeployment%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank">

2. A new window should pop up that prompts you to log into your Azure account. 

3. Once logged in, you should see a page similar to this. Select the subscription you want to use. I have chosen to create a new resource group titled "CognitiveServices12345" and selected West US 2 for the Location. Decide on a "Resource Name" for your resources. This will be prepended to the names of the resources created. Keep track of this name as we will use it later.![DeployPage](../../../docs/images/DeployPage.png)<br/>

4. Check the box to agree to the terms and conditions

5. Click "Purchase"

6. You're resources should be deployed after a minute or two.

7. You should now have a resource group and some resources underneath it. 
Here is what mine looks like:
![DeployPage](../../../docs/images/Resources.png)<br/>
You'll notice how the resource name was used.
You will also need the following strings to use further down.
    * LUIS authoring key.
    * speech subscription key.
    * azure subscription key. - look for Subscriptions in Azure and you should be able to find it.
    * website for task completion. In our case this is the hospitality room website.
    


## Deploying your Custom Commands Application
1. Open a powershell window and cd into the deployment directory
2. run .\createSpeechApp.ps1 with the following parameters:
* -speechResourceKey YOUR_SPEECH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY
* -resourceName RESOURCENAME_USED_IN_DEPLOYING
* -azureSubscriptionId AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID 
* -luisAuthoringKey LUIS_AUTHORING_KEY
* -websiteAddress WEBSITE_FOR_TASK_COMPLETION
* -resourceGroup RESOURCE_GROUP

It should look something like this:

    .\createSpeechApp.ps1 -speechResourceKey YOUR_SPEECH_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY -websiteAddress WEBSITE_FOR_TASK_COMPLETION -resourceName RESOURCENAME_USED_IN_DEPLOYING -azureSubscriptionId AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID  -luisAuthoringKey LUIS_AUTHORING_KEY -resourceGroup RESOURCE_GROUP

Once complete you will be able to see your new Custom Commands application in the [Speech Studio](https://speech.microsoft.com) by selecting your "Speech Resource". In the example above it would be MyNewResources-speech. Click on "Go To Studio" and then "Custom Commands".
