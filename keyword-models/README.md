# Keyword Models

This folder contains example keyword models (.table files). Configure any of the client sample code in this repository to use one of the .table files here, or create your own keyword model from the [Custom Keyword](https://speech.microsoft.com/customkeyword) portal.

These were created by Microsoft's keyword modeling team and are higher quality. We recommend you use these:

* Abigail
* Assistant
* Computer
* Hey Front Desk
* Jayden
* Ok Speaker

 The others were created using the Microsoft Custom Keyword portal:

* Contoso
