# Keyword Models

This folder contains example keyword models (.table files) created using the Microsoft [Custom Keyword](https://speech.microsoft.com/customkeyword) portal. Configure any of the client sample code in this repository to use one of the .table files here, or create your own keyword model from the portal.
