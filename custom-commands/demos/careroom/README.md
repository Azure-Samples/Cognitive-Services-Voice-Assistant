## Domain

In this demo we simulate a hospital room or healthcare facility and use voice to control some of the devices in the room - The television, air-conditioning, blinds and wall lamp. The dialog is similar to the one in the hospitality demo, just different visuals

## Supported language

en-us

## Example sentences

Here are a few examples. Try these or others of your choice:
* Turn on the light
* Lights off
* Turn off the AC
* Set the temperature to 71 degrees
* Raise the temperature
* Open the blinds
* Blinds down
* TV on
* Turn it off

If you configured your client application to listen for a keyword, say the keyword first followed by the above (or other) sentences (e.g. "computer, turn on the lights").
