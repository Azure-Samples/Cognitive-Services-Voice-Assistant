![scene image](../images/inventory-scene.png)

## Domain

In this demo we simulate a warehouse with inventory (boxes with different colors and sizes). We use voice to control removing or adding boxes, or query the inventory.

## Supported language

en-us

## Example sentences

Here are a few examples. Try these or others of your choice:
* Add four blue boxes
* Remove yellow boxes
* Add three large boxes
* Ship two small boxes
* Sell five medium boxes
* Order boxes
* What do we have in stock?
* How many large boxes are in stock?
* How many medium boxes do we have?
* Count green boxes
* What can I do?
* Ship everything in stock

If you configured your client application to listen for a keyword, say the keyword first followed by the above (or other) sentences (e.g. "computer, count green boxes")
