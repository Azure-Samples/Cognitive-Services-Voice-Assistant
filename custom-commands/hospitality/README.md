## Domain

In this demo we simulate a hotel room and use voice to control some of the devices in the room - The television, air-conditioning, and the lights.

## Example sentences

Here are a few examples. Try these and others of your own:
* Turn on the lights
* Turn off the bathroom lights
* Room lights off
* Turn off the AC
* Set the temperature to 71 degrees
* Raise the temperature
* TV on
* Turn it off

If you configured you client application to listen for a keyword, say the keyword first followed by the above (or other) sentences.
