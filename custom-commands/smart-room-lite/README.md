# Smart Room Lite - A Custom Commands application

## Purpose
This application is built with the goal of being used as a quick-start for documentation hosted on docs.microsoft.com
Alternatively, it can also be used by the users to verify their changes, in case they have difficult following through the documentation.

Here, we have tried to use most of the features provide by the Custom Commands platform to build a simple application.
